# Hackathon

This is our project for the WPI hackathon.  It is an application built in java which allows students to connect with other students at their school
in their classes.  The application stores a users informaiton in a database everytime the applicaiton is run.  Knowing this would concern many, the application
has a large emphasis on secirtiy and privacy.  The private information of a user (their email) is encrypted before being stored in the database. When the 
application needs to access a users email, it decrypts it. Furthermore, the applicaion gives users flexability as for which information they will make public, 
such as weather or not they are on campus.  

Whenever this program is run, it assumes a new user is creaating an account.  The data everytime it is run is stored in a text file called data.txt.
Somme example data is has already been put in data.txt.
